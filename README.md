Exploring programming in a style inspired by ecological and embodied cognitive science

A summary of the project can be found in the About page of the [project-specific blog](https://nh.oddly-influenced.dev/).

The rationale for the project is laid out in a series of podcast episodes (all have transcripts):
* [Excerpt: Concepts without Categories](https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/excerpt-concepts-without-categories)
* [The offloaded brain, part 1: behavior](https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/e41-the-offloaded-brain-part-1-behavior)
* [The offloaded brain, part 2: applications](https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/e42-the-offloaded-brain-part-2-applications)
* [The offloaded brain, part 3: dynamical systems](https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/e43-the-offloaded-brain-part-3-dynamical-systems)
* [The offloaded brain, part 4: an interview with David Chapman](https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/e44-an-interview-with-david-chapman-about-the-offloaded-brain)
* [The offloaded brain, part 5: I propose a software design style](https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/e45-the-offloaded-brain-part-5-i-propose-a-software-design-style)

The core application will be the "app-animal", a Swift app to help me create podcast scripts. It's in the directory `app-animal`. Prototypes will be written in Elixir, nested under directory `prototypes`.
